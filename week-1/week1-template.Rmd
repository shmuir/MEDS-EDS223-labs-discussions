## introduction
In this lab, we'll explore the basics of map-making in R using the **tmap** package.
The following materials are modified from [Chapter 9 of Geocomputation with R by Rovin Lovelace](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html)
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## prerequisites
Let's install all the necessary packages to reproduce code from Geocomp with R.
```{r}
# install.packages("spDataLarge", repos = "https://geocompr.r-universe.dev")
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("geocompx/geocompkg")
```
Let's load all necessary packages.
```{r load, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(dplyr)
library(spData)
library(spDataLarge)
#remotes::install_github("r-tmap/tmap@v4")
library(tmap)    # for static and interactive maps
library(leaflet) # for interactive maps
library(ggplot2) # tidyverse data visualization package
```

Let's also read in some data from the **spDataLarge** package to work with later.
```{r include=TRUE}
nz_elev = rast(system.file("raster/nz_elev.tif", package = "spDataLarge"))
```

## map-making basics

Let's start with a pre-loaded spatial object representing the states of New Zealand

```{r include=TRUE}
nz
```

-   we're going to start by using the **tmap** package to make some basic maps
-   **tmap** can work with spatial objects of a variety of clasess, meaning it's highly versatile
-   this approach relies on a series of functions that typically start with "tm\_"

the first element is always "tm_shape"

```{r include=TRUE}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_fill()
```

now let's plot just the boundaries

```{r include=TRUE}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_borders()
```

and the shapes and boundaries together

```{r include=TRUE}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_fill() +
  tm_borders()
```

## map objects

-   **tmap** can store maps as *objects*
-   this means that we store a base map and add additional layers later

```{r include = TRUE}
map_nz <- tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_polygons()

class(map_nz)
```

-   we can add new shapes on top of the base map
-   when we add a new shape, all subsequent aesthetic functions refer to it, until we add a new shape

In this case, we're adding a layer with information on elevation and this layer to have 70% transparency.

```{r include = TRUE}
map_nz1 <- map_nz +
  tm_shape(nz_elev) +
  tm_raster(alpha = 0.7)

map_nz1
```

we can add points designating high points in the country

```{r include = TRUE}
map_nz1 +
  tm_shape(nz_height) + #nz_height pre-loaded in spdata
  tm_dots()
```

## aesthetic basics

-   up until now, we've been working with the default aesthetics
-   there are 2 types of aesthetics: fixed and those that change with the value of a variable
-   **tmap** works differently than **ggplot2** and doesn't use the "aes()" function

Let's start by changing some fixed aesthetics...First, let's change the color used to fill the NZ shapes.

now change the color of the boundaries
and the width of the boundary lines
and the line type of the boundary lines
all together now!


```{r include=TRUE}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_polygons(col = "lightblue", border.col = "black", lwd = 3, lty = 2)
```

Now let's change the colors based on a value. We noticed that the New Zealand dataset has a column with each state's land area

```{r include=TRUE}
nz
```

Let's try to plot the Land_area column. We might think that the following works, but it doesn't!

```{r include=TRUE}
# tm_shape(nz) +
#   tm_fill(col = nz$Land_area)
```

Instead, **tmap** is expecting a character string naming the attribute associated with the geometry

```{r include = TRUE}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_fill(col = "Land_area")
```

We can also add an argument that updates the title of the legend

```{r include=TRUE}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_fill(col = "Land_area", title = "Land Area")
```

We can even make it more precise using the "expression" function

```{r include=TRUE}

```

## color settings

-   how we set and define colors can radically change the interpretation of our maps
-   the style argument has several options for breaking data into bins
    -   **style = "pretty"** (default) rounds breaks into evenly spaced whole numbers, where possible
    -   **style = "equal"** divides input values into bins with equal range (best for uniform distributions)
    -   **style = "quantile"** puts the same number of observations into each bin
    -   **style = "jenks"** identifies groups of similar values and maximizes differences between bins

Notice how the following maps display the same data, but look quite different    
```{r include=TRUE}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_polygons(col = "Median_income", style = "pretty")
```

```{r include=TRUE}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_polygons(col = "Median_income", style = "quantile")
```

```{r include=TRUE}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_polygons(col = "Median_income", style = "jenks")
```

We can also define custom bins
```{r include=TRUE}
breaks = c(0, 3, 4, 5) * 10000

tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_polygons(col = "Median_income", breaks = breaks)
```

-   in some cases we might not want to use bins
    -   **style = "cont"** displays colors as a continuous spectrum
    -   **style = "cat"** uses a unique vale for each categorical value
```{r include=TRUE}
# map_nz +
#   tm_shape(nz_elev) +
#   tm_raster(alpha = 0.7, style = "cont")
```

```{r include=TRUE}

```   
  
## map layout
-   now that we have the basics, we can turn to all the other elements that make a cohesive map
-   **tmap** has lots of options, but we will explore just a few

To clearly give readers the context of our map, we can include a compass and scale bar
```{r include=TRUE}
map_nz +
  tm_compass(type = "4star", position = c("left", "top")) +
  tm_scale_bar()
```

Instead of using a compass and scale bar, we could add latitude/longitudes graticules
```{r include=TRUE}
map_nz +
  tm_graticules()
```

We can also update the background color
```{r include=TRUE}
map_nz +
  tm_graticules() +
  tm_layout(bg.color = "lightblue")
```

## faceted and animated maps
-   we might have data that varies over time and we want to look at the how it changes
-   one approach is by using faceted plots, a series of plots

```{r include=TRUE}

```


## interactive maps
-   **tmap** is especially powerful because it allows us to make interactive maps using the same syntax
-   all we need to do is enter the interactive mode

```{r include=TRUE}
tmap_mode("view")
map_nz
```

To go back to regular plotting, we just need enter plotting mode
```{r include=TRUE}
tmap_mode("plot")
map_nz
```
